LexicalAnalyzer
Developed a lexical analyzer also known as a scanner in C++ programming language which is entirely based on the theory of automata. 
The program takes input from a text file a C++ code will be given to the program through a text file.
The lexical analyzer will generate tokens of C++ language and saves them into a 2d array. 
I have also maintained a 3d array for the symbol table for maintaining the identifiers of the C++ language.
